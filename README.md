The Witcher 2 Issues
====================

**Unofficial** Github page used for tracking issues related to the Witcher 2 on Linux.

This was created in response to the steam thread found [here](http://steamcommunity.com/app/20920/discussions/0/522728180993106963/?tscn=1401152244) which was created to help the developers identify important issues in the Witcher 2.

The main aim of this repo is to allow users to better communicate their findings on bugs they found on the Witcher 2 for Linux. By organising bugs and associated fixes I hope to allow users to solve any issues they are having.

Numerous workarounds have already been found for a number of issues so make sure to take a look at all the items marked with the "workaround" tag.
